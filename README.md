# swe1-app

This is a simple, hello word django application

Itâ€™ll consist of two parts:

1. A public site that lets people view polls and vote in them.
   
2. An admin site that lets you add, change, and delete polls.

Try out my public django polls application [here](http://django-env.eba-mh7mgqqg.us-west-2.elasticbeanstalk.com/polls)
